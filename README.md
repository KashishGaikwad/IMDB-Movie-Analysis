# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
A Data Analysis on the IMDB movie scores and ratings.
 The dataset is related to IMDB Movies, their directiors, actors, music directors, writers, budget their profit they got on box office and the ratings they scored on IMDB.
To get the deeper knowledge of data, I have given somne question provided by the Tainity. 
Five 'Whys' Approach: This technique helped me to dig deeper into the problem.
    Q1: "Why do movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings?"
    Q2: "Why does better production quality lead to higher ratings?"
    Q3: "Why does an enhanced viewer experience lead to higher ratings?
    Q4: "Why are viewers more likely to rate a movie highly if they enjoyed watching it?"
    Q5: "Why do positive reviews matter?"
